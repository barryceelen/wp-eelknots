# WP Eelknots

A variation on Marc Jaquith's excellent [WordPress Skeleton](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton).
Helpful to get a WordPress project bootstrapped quickly.

WordPress is added as a submodule in the `wp` folder.

Usually I don't have the luxury of having git installed in the server.
I like to deploy stuff via the [dandelion](https://github.com/scttnlsn/dandelion) gem. An example dandelion.yml file is included.
